                I currently work with a small team on research with <b>robotic heavy construction
                equipment</b>.
                We recently finished a robotic retrofit of a piece of heavy equipment, where I
                focused on proprioception and compute integration. 
                This included architecting the robot's <b>ROS2</b> software stack, writing device
                drivers for and configuring <b>ROS2_controls</b>, setting up a new robot model,
                tuning controllers, integrating in-house autonomous blade controllers, reverse
                engineering vehicle communications, and of course making tons of electrical harnesses.
                Really, it was a little bit (a lot) of everything, all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're currently focused on <b>training / finetuning</b> models to enable greater
                autonomy on our platform.
                We've developed a data collection, conversion, and training pipeline based on
                in-cab operator inputs.
                As a result, I've gotten pretty good at driving heavy equipment!
            </p>

                Previously, I've worked on <b>localization and computer vision</b> for the same
                team (mostly on a different platform).
                Wrote some software to estimate bulldozerblade pose from visual data (wish I had
                more time to spend on this it was superfun).
                Also added several improvements to the localization subsystem, mostly cleaning it
                up and making it actually stochastic.
                This also meant working with tons of GIS data, creating a pipeline to standardize
                all data inputs and georeference data outputs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I've worked on a <b>historical preservation project</b> recording the
                architectural, historical, and political significance of cold war era launch sites
                in Vandenberg Space Force Base.
                (This included site visits!)
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 2ch;">
                I have also conducted some exploratory <b>urban geography research</b>, looking
                into the interplay between urban highway bridge infrastructure and the surrounding
                urban population (urban morphology stuff).
