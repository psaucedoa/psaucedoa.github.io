            <p style="padding-bottom: 2ch;">
                I never really thought about it until relatively recently, 
                but it is kind of surprising how well citrus grows at my grandpa's
                house. There's multiple orange, lime, and lemon trees with branches
                that end up sagging under the weight of all their fruit.
                Kind of took it for granted, condsidering the surrounding
                terrain looks like this:
            </p>
            <img src="../images/mex/asc.JPG" alt="Sample of the environment near my parent's home" class="default-image-border"/>
            <p>
                Very dusty.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be fair, there's wet and dry seasons. During the wet season the dust gets displaced
                by a vegitative green, with the transformation spurred by intermittent torrential downpours.
                The stormy days are some of my favorite, mostly because it's a great excuse to do nothing.
                Just hang out in someone's kitchen drinking coffee. It can be a little hard to have
                actual conversations though, since the sound of rain smacking <u>sheet metal roofs</u> tends
                to drown everything else out.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's gorgeous though. Streets turn into little rivers, carving out
                the unpaved alleys and sending their material downstream until reaching the paved roads near
                the busier parts of town. The paved roads in turn kinda of start looking like those
                unpaved alleys, with all the sand, pebbles, and rocks covering up the neat cement sections.
                
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 2ch;">
                Anyway, those rains must replentish some sort of <u>aquifer</u> (or maybe the citrus trees are 
                goated and bulk up on water), because you end up with fruits like these:
            </p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 2ch;">
                And little views like this:

                <b>Small Towns</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Driving through Illinois (off the interstate) you get to drive through tons of little
                towns. Lots of these little towns are pretty dilapidated, with most storefronts looking
                like the one in the image above.
                This is the thing <i>everyone's</i> been talking about for the past, like, 40 or 50 years.
                Death, decline, despair.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few small towns here and there look like they're doing fine, from a driver's seat 
                point-of-view. I think these are just the ones that are near hubs, like small cities
                or large towns, whose residents don't face push or pull factors to the same degree as
                the more isolated towns further from any economic center.
            </p>
            <p>
                And really, that's all it is. Well, "all it is" does tons of legwork here. Of course it's
                easy to say it's just economic push and pull factors, because anything can be a 
                push or pull. But I guess I mean that "push and pull" is a good framework to start
                analyzing the deterioration of small town America. Instead of placing blame on
                some abstract process or entity - <i>globalization! NAFTA! China!</i> - one should look at
                specific reasons individuals may be encouraged to <i>leave</i> a place and <i>go</i>
                somewhere else. Hu Jintao didn't just snap his fingers and force the American ruling class
                to shut down World Class Sporting Goods in Smallville, Illinois. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To be fair, basically no
                one is saying this exactly, but the sentiment  that can be extracted from all the noise around
                this issue kind of approximates this. Maybe insted of the Chinese Premier, it's a free 
                trade agreement, or some international organization, or some politician.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 2ch;">
                Anyway, I might be biased, but these places remind me of somehwere else.

            </p>

            <p>
                It's really interesting how this exact same problem is seen across many small towns
                in Mexico, but I haven't seen many comparisons between the two geographies. The follwing is
                mostly based on anectodal experience (maybe I'll find some numbers and add those in).
            </p>
            <p>
                My dad's village in Mexico is still fairly vibrant, but it's definitely changing.
                There's many small children running around during the summer, and plenty of
                older adults to keep an eye on them. Small corner stores remain open, serving
                <u>fresh tortillas</u> every morning. Farmers work the <i>ejidos</i>, ensuring the
                new grain depot is busy. A new clinic was just built with funding from the federal
                government. During the summer months and around Christmas the dance halls blast music
                well into the morning hours. Almost everyone now has those shiny stainless steel
                solar water heaters.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, many young adults (including
                most of those in my family) have left. Some say it'll only be temporary.
                Others are more realistic with themselves and leave for good, with plans to
                (maybe, potentially) come back during retirement. Where are they going? 
                The United States. What are they doing? Working.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 2ch;">
                They are earning wages and enjoying a material quality of life that easily surpasses
                what the vast mojority of them could have attained by staying in Mexico. They are
                leaving an environment that many consider dangerous, <u>spurred by factors</u> outside of
                any one individual's control.
                Many barriers - some physical, some legal, some cultural, some interpersonal -
                lie between these young adults and the relative splendor of the USA.
                But on average, that does little to dissuade the young.
            </p>
            
            <img src="../images/mex/torreon.JPG" alt="Road signage" class="default-image-border"/>
            <p>
                The choice to leave, spurred mainly by economic considerations, has many downstream
                political, economic, and demographic effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Politically, well, we're kinda in the middle of it I guess. This one's a lot, and
                honestly I'm not gonna think about it right now lmao.
            </p>
            <p>
                Economically, there's a few key things. 
                First, the individuals that seek out lives up north enjoy materially better lives.
                New(ish) phones, clothes, vehicles, better medical care, a safer environment, 
                and just much, much higher wages in general compared to what could have been 
                obtained by staying. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, they provide much needed abor to the largest and most advanced global 
                economy. Again, I should go back and include some solid data here, but the main idea
                is that these new workers integrate into the US economy by performing lower-skilled 
                labor. This, in turn, effectively allows the existing population (usually with better
                education and training) to up-skill and perform more productive labor. 
            </p>
            <p>                
                Third, they inject money into the local economy back home in Mexico. Basically
                everyone sends some money back to the family that remains in Mexico. This is a huge
                boost to families and local economies, since the USD has such enormous purchasing power.
                A small fraction of a US worker's pay goes a long way in small-town Mexico. Effectively,
                this itself boosts outcomes in Mexico, as people can afford better / more goods and 
                services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bascially, just a more efficient allocation of labor that benefits everyone.
                Also my theory that this is the reason behind the success of the American and
                Chinese economies. Both places have a large pool of relatively poor rural communities
                (for the US nowadays, thats Mexico).
                Both places have wealthy, highly advanced metropoli with highly skilled and educated
                workforces.
                And both places have high economic migration from the poorer rural regions to the wealthy
                regions where lower-skilled labor is needed. This is the engine of prosperity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, this economic migration has distinct demographic effects. Primarily, the gradual
                depopulation of the rural towns where the migrants originate from, shifting that growth
                to the urban centers the migrants move to. I mean, it's kind of obvious, as this has been
                happening since the dawn of civilization. Well, at least the growth of urban centers.
                I don't know if rural regions have depoopulated as drastically as we're seeing now.
                I should check.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 2ch;">
                Anyway, this also means that the children of said migrants will grow up and live in the
                United States, instead of some rural village. Effectively, shifting population growth
                from rural towns to the wealthier, urban regions. 
            </p>

                <b>The(ir) kids yearn for the mines</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A few things. I think it's interesting how much bandwidth is afforded to depopulating rural
                towns in the USA, and how many treat it as some enigma, when basically the same thing
                is happening south of the border, which everyone is suddenly expert on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the "solution" to the rural depopulation "problem" is basically the same for both
                regions. The specifics might differ, but it's just a matter of making these rural regions
                better places to live. Have them offer more economic pull factors that do enough to keep
                people in. Or alternatively, increase barriers that make it much harder to migrate. The
                problem with the latter is that realistically, it doesn't work. This can be seen through the
                (now legal?) internal migration in China in spite of the Hukou system, or the large migration
                from Mexico to the US in spite of our migration restrictions. Even if one could raise barriers 
                enough to stop this process, I don't think it would be good for anyone. Economic migration
                isn't some zero-sum process. Quite the opposite, really.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, so make these rural regions better places to live. 
                How? Well, that's the million dollar question.
                There have been some directed efforts by the Biden administration to encourage high-tech
                factories (like battery plants, semi-conductor fabs) to open up shop in rural regions across
                the USA. It was also thought that by focusing investment in more red / rural regions, it
                would make it harder for republican administrations to remove the subsidies supporting
                these high-tech jobs if their consitutents depended on them (lmao). Some even suggest
                that with the advent of remote work, small towns could become attractive places for young
                adults due to the drastically lower cost of living. And even if American young adults still 
                don't find these rural regions appealing, millions of immigrants would.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>But the problem is that many of these small rural towns, even when offered such 
                opportunities, are actively hostile towards them! Because batteries and solar panels
                and remote work and migration and any change at all is gay, I guess. Even when you have 
                millions of people dreaming to join and contribute to the USA, whether in 
                Los Angeles, California or Springfield, Ohio.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Small towns in Mexico don't have the luxury of complaining about industrial investment. Well,
                people are people, so some probably still do. But it's mainly bebcause there might not be the
                same interest or capacity to invest in these rural regions. Or it might not even be seen as a 
                problem. People like my parents recognize that there is very little opportunity in these rural
                regions. That's the entire reason why they migrated, and why people like me are here.
            </p>
            <p>
                People love talking about bringing back factories, bringing back steel mills, bringing back
                whatever it is that made small-town America great.

                Urban geographies too, are suffocated by the car, as seen by the scars of highways and interstates, 
                four-lane roads and tiny sidewalks. It's a well covered topic as of late.

                Waymo is expanding like crazy, after however long of an eternity it spent
                being SF exclusive. It's a really good solution for the first problem - the whole "people suck" thing -
                since it removes people from being in control of the vehicle.
                And so far it's really safe, superhuman safe. Mostly since it's got tons of sensors on it that
                literally give it capabilites greater than those of a human.

                Anyway, one of the scarier thoughts I've been having lately is that autonomous driving will
                truly take off.

                We make our choices basedbased on trade-offs. If a driver knows traffic is going to be atrocious,
                usually they choose one of the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                > Take a different route
                <br/>
                > Take a different mode of transport
                <br/>
                > Not travel at all
                <br/>
                > Body the awful drive and feel physical pain in nuts to butts traffic
            </p>
            <p>
                Problems arise when you remove or severely diminish the cost of driving.
                Not the literal cost, but the "what would I rather be doing with my time right now" cost.
                Its easy for me to imagine a world in which everyone starts using driverless cab services 
                and now the length of the car ride doesn't nearly matter as much. Honestly, it could even
                be a good thing for people trying to catchup on some work before heading into the office,
                for people who are content scrolling for undeterminate amounts of time, or for other people
                still who might take a long commute in a driverless car as an opportunity to get some additional sleep.

                "Well, that all sounds great! Removing the suck out of driving!" <i>That's exactly the problem.</i>
                I fear it would just excacerbate the whole destruction-of-the-urban-fabric thing that car-centered 
                urban infrastructure drives. Way more people could be on the roads, just because they are fine with
                much longer trip times. And, full nightmare scenario, it gets to a point where road infrastructure
                <i>has to be upgraded</i> due to sheer demand. Why bother walking to and from a metro station when
                you can just "no thoughts, head empty" command a private vehicle to take you directly from 
                point A to point B. At this point, why bother <i>investing</i> in public transit at all?
                Constituents would not be happy to learn that resources are going to trains or whatever instead of
                their potholes.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 2ch;">
                I think this all in spite of the fact that private driverless cab rides would <u>probably be much more 
                expensive</u> than an equivalent bus or train. People are rich! I mean just look at 
                Uber Eats / Grub Hub / Doordash. Even people that can't afford food delivery still use it.
                There are people with Go Puff Klarna debt! I know some of them! So it becomes very easy for me
                to extrapolate into this nightmare scenario. Idk, perhaps I'm biased. I hope so, anyway.

                We might just get stuck with chronically underfunded public transit 
                (worse than even now) and all the social malaise that stems from atomizing social interactions
                between random people in the urban landscape.

                It really, really feels like this next decade is our last chance at getting it right with mass
                transit and the urban form.
